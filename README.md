# Grassland Project Site Identification

These plots are intended to be used together with the Google Earth Engine interactive site explorer: [https://jdmwhite.users.earthengine.app/view/grassland-project-site-identification](https://jdmwhite.users.earthengine.app/view/grassland-project-site-identification) to help show the legends and summaries for the land cover and environmental layers. 

Two approaches were used to select sites:
1) [Sand content](sand.md)
2) [Surface lithology](lithology.md)
